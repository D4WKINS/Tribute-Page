<h1 class="heading heading-2">Early Life</h1>

<div class="early-life-1">
    <p> His stage name, a play on the name of comedian Nipsey Russell, originated as a nickname given to Asghedom by a childhood friend.
        The "Hussle" came from his entrepreneurial spirit. He shined shoes for $2.50 to pay for school clothes at age 11 
        with a goal of a hundred shoes a day. </p>
</div>



<div class="early-life-2">

         mass incarceration, de-industrialization, racist police brutality,
          overcrowded schools and declining social services.<br><br>
        Nipsey got involved in the gang life by joining the Crips at a young age.
        Hussle attended Alexander Hamilton High School which he later dropped out 
        before graduating because he was accused of breaking into a school computer lab.

    <p> At the age of 19, Asghedom's father took both him and his brother Samuel on a trip to Eritrea, 
        East Africa for three months in 2004. Asghedom credited the trip with inspiring him to become a community activist</p>

<h1 class="heading heading-4">Business</h1>

    <div class="b-e-1">
    <p> Hussle opened the Marathon Clothing store on June 17, 2017, which he founded along with partners Steve Carless, Karen Civil, and
         his brother Samiel Asghedom. Opening the store at this intersection in the Crenshaw commercial district was important
          to him because he wanted to invest and provide opportunities in his neighborhood of Hyde Park. 
        </p>
    </div>




<div class="b-e-2">
        <p>The store is billed as a "smart store," which bridges the gap between culture and technology by giving customers
           access to exclusive music and other content created by rappers through an app created by software engineer Iddris Sandu.<br><br>
           The year before his death, Hussle had bought the small shopping center where his store was located, 
           after partnering with the real estate investor David Gross. </p>
